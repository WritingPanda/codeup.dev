				<p><h2>The <strong>Pandas</strong> send their <em>regards</em></h2></p>
				<p>My name is Omar Quimbaya, a writer, noob programmer, and sinophile.
				<br>I have given a lot of my time to other people instead of giving it to myself.
				<br>This is both a <em>good</em> thing and <strong>bad</strong> thing.
				<br>One of my favorite quotes is:
				<blockquote><h2>"Without struggle, there can be no progress."</h2></blockquote>
				I am not sure who said that, but I think they were right.
				<br>Without struggling for something, you cannot move forward.
				<br>Staying still is just too easy.</p>

				<h2>Questions I'm Often Asked</h2>
					<dl>
						<dt>Why do people call you panda?</dt>
						<dd>It's because I am a panda. Were you expecting something else?</dd>
						<dt>Why do you like <a href="http://codeup.dev/changshafam" target="_blank">China</a> so much?</dt>
						<dd>China is an amazing country with a history that dates back 5,000 years.
							<br> It's an old civilization adapting to a brand new world. It's exciting to read and hear more about it!</dd>
						<dt>Why did you choose Codeup?</dt>
						<dd>I have two great passions in life: <em>education</em> and <em>technology</em>.
							<br>Codeup made sense to me in that it allows me to combine both into one neat package.</dd>

			<p>The <a href="http://automobiles.honda.com/fit/" target="_blank">2015 Honda Fit</a> is a 5-door hatchback filled to the brim with features and safety in mind along with the benefit of great fuel economy.<br>The technology available in the vehicle has been significantly upgraded from the last generations as well as having a newer, more aggressive look.<br>Honda, in the past, has made cars with somewhat of an unimpressive look to them, as seen in entry-level vehicles, such as the Civic.<br>However, with this new entry, Honda has provided the market with a competitve vehicle to go up against the likes of the Ford Fiesta and Mazda 3.</p></center>
